# Chest-X-Ray-Pneumonia-Dignosis-using-CNN
In this project we will create a Convolutional Neural Network to classify Chest X-Ray scans from patients with pneumonia.

The dataset is downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) and organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal).
