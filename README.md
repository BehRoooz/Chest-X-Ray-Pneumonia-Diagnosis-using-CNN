# Chest-X-Ray-Pneumonia-Dignosis-using-CNN
Pneumonia is an inflammatory condition of the lung primarily affecting the small air sacs known as alveoli. Symptoms typically include some combination of productive or dry cough, chest pain, fever, and difficulty breathing. Pneumonia is caused by infection with viruses or bacteria, and less commonly by other microorganisms. Pneumonia is typically diagnosed based on a combination of physical signs and often a chest X-ray.

In this project we will create a Convolutional Neural Network to classify Chest X-Ray scans from patients with pneumonia.

The dataset is downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) and organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal).
